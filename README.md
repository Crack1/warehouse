Summary
We'd like to see from your work:
* Preferrably Yii 2 framework
* MySQL
* AJAX
* Clean HTML and CSS
* Publish on GitHub
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

Administrator: user: erwin, password: 123456
Employee: user: rommel, password: 123456.


Points to improve:

* The migrations could be used to  generate the database.
* The RBAC can be applied for an application more complex.
* The reporting services can be one of the main functionality.


The Warehouse application  use the advanced template provided for Yii2, but just the backend is functional because all the administration is controled en the back end.

* The sql information is located in the file "yii_warehouse.sql"
* To use the actual images the main folder should be called "warehouse"
